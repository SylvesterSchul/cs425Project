Rachel Lo, Sylvester Schulteis, Jagger Vicente

The project implements a user to user collaborative filtering algorithm for the purpose of recommending movies. The algorithm utilizes the MovieLens database accessed through pandas library in Python.. For the purpose of the project, a small version of the database containing 193609 movies and 100837 ratings was utilized. The algorithm creates a pearson correlation coefficient to analyze the similarity between users. The top 5 most similar users then provide their top recommendation.

The project additionally contains some visualization and preprocessing to utilize an imported collaborative filtering. These are used to show more regarding the data and test different methods.
